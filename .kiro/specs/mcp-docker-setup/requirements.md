# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature creates a comprehensive Docker-based MCP (Model Context Protocol) server setup that consolidates multiple MCP servers into a single deployable container. The system will integrate six MCP servers: sequential-thinking, memory, time (from the existing configuration), plus context7, e2b, and exa servers. The solution provides a unified, containerized environment for running multiple MCP services with proper configuration management and environment variable handling.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to deploy multiple MCP servers in a single Docker container, so that I can easily manage and distribute a comprehensive MCP server environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Docker container is built THEN it SHALL include all six MCP servers (sequential-thinking, memory, time, context7, e2b, exa)
2. WHEN the container starts THEN it SHALL properly initialize all MCP servers with their required dependencies
3. WHEN the container is deployed THEN it SHALL expose the necessary ports and interfaces for MCP communication
4. WHEN the container runs THEN it SHALL handle multiple concurrent MCP server processes efficiently

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want proper environment variable management for API keys and configuration, so that I can securely configure the MCP servers without hardcoding sensitive information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API keys are required THEN the system SHALL accept them through environment variables (E2B_API_KEY, EXA_API_KEY)
2. WHEN environment variables are missing THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages indicating which keys are required
3. WHEN the container starts THEN it SHALL validate that all required environment variables are present
4. WHEN configuration is provided THEN it SHALL be properly passed to the respective MCP servers

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a unified configuration system, so that I can easily manage all MCP server settings from a single configuration file.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the container starts THEN it SHALL read configuration from a unified JSON configuration file
2. WHEN configuration changes are made THEN they SHALL be applied without requiring container rebuilds
3. WHEN the configuration file is provided THEN it SHALL override default settings for each MCP server
4. WHEN invalid configuration is provided THEN the system SHALL provide clear validation error messages

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want proper dependency management and installation, so that all MCP servers have their required runtime dependencies available.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the container is built THEN it SHALL install Node.js and Python runtime environments
2. WHEN the container is built THEN it SHALL install uvx and npx package managers
3. WHEN MCP servers are initialized THEN they SHALL have access to all required system dependencies
4. WHEN package installation occurs THEN it SHALL use specific versions to ensure reproducible builds

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want comprehensive documentation and examples, so that I can easily understand how to build, configure, and deploy the MCP server container.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documentation is provided THEN it SHALL include clear build instructions for the Docker container
2. WHEN examples are provided THEN they SHALL show how to configure each MCP server type
3. WHEN deployment instructions are given THEN they SHALL include docker-compose examples with environment variables
4. WHEN troubleshooting information is provided THEN it SHALL cover common configuration and deployment issues

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the container to be production-ready, so that I can deploy it in various environments with confidence.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the container runs THEN it SHALL implement proper health checks for all MCP servers
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide structured logging for debugging
3. WHEN the container is deployed THEN it SHALL handle graceful shutdown of all MCP processes
4. WHEN resource limits are applied THEN the container SHALL operate efficiently within constrained environments
